# Understanding and Applying IF Statements in PL/SQL

PL/SQL's IF statement is a fundamental part of the language, mirroring the behavior of similar constructs in modern procedural languages. It allows the definition of conditional execution paths based on the evaluation of boolean expressions. In this document, we'll explore how IF statements work in PL/SQL, supported by examples drawn from daily life situations and translated into code.

## The Basic IF Statement

The basic IF statement in PL/SQL allows us to perform an action if a certain condition is met. It's equivalent to saying, "If I'm going to the store, I'll take my wallet." Here is what that situation would look like expressed as a PL/SQL code:

```plsql
IF going_to_store = TRUE THEN
    wallet := 'In pocket';
END IF;
```
In this code, if the condition `going_to_store = TRUE` is met, the action of placing the wallet 'In pocket' is executed. There are no alternative paths here; the action occurs if the condition is true, and nothing happens if it's not.

## IF-ELSE Statement

The IF-ELSE statement allows us to define an alternative action in case the condition in the IF statement is not met. Consider the situation: "If I have cash, I'll pay for groceries with cash. Otherwise, I'll use a payment method with my phone." In PL/SQL, this scenario can be represented as follows:

```plsql
IF have_cash = TRUE THEN
    payment_method := 'cash';
ELSE
    payment_method := 'phone';
END IF;
```
In this case, if `have_cash = TRUE`, the `payment_method` is set to 'cash'. If `have_cash` is not true, the ELSE path is followed, and `payment_method` is set to 'phone'.

## IF-ELSIF Statement

The IF-ELSIF statement (ELSE IF in some languages) is used when we need to test multiple conditions and execute a different action for each one. For example, "If I have cash, I'll pay with cash. If not, but I have a credit card, I'll use that. If I have neither, I'll try a debit card. If none of these are true, I leave the store with no groceries." This situation can be implemented as a PL/SQL IF-ELSIF statement:

```plsql
IF have_cash = TRUE THEN
    payment_method := 'cash';
ELSIF have_credit_card = TRUE THEN
    payment_method := 'credit card';
ELSIF have_debit_card = TRUE THEN
    payment_method := 'debit card';
ELSE
    payment_method := NULL;
END IF;
```
In this case, multiple conditions are evaluated in order, and the first one that is true determines the action to be taken. If none of the conditions are true, the ELSE path is executed.

## Syntax and Best Practices

All IF statements in PL/SQL start with the IF keyword and end with the END IF keywords. At each decision point, a boolean expression is evaluated. This could involve any kind of comparison operator or column in the expression. If the result is true, the lines of code right after it are executed, or else it continues to the next evaluation, if any.

A single default condition uses ELSE with no expression. Multiple conditions require ELSIF followed by another condition test. Once the first boolean expression is found to be true, it executes the code right afterwards and continues after END IF.

## A Complete Example

Consider a PL/SQL block that displays a daily message based on the day of the week. The first thing it does is extract the day of the week from a date function. If it's either Saturday or Sunday, it displays a related message; otherwise, it's a weekday and it's the last alternative in the IF statement.

```plsql
DECLARE
    day_of_week VARCHAR(10);
BEGIN
    SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'Day') INTO day_of_week FROM dual;
    
    IF day_of_week = 'Saturday' OR day_of_week = 'Sunday' THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Enjoy your weekend!');
    ELSE
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Have a productive day!');
    END IF;
END;
/
```
In this block, once one of the conditions is found to be true, the related message is displayed, and then execution continues after the END IF.
