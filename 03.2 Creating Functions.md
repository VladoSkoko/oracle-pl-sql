# Creating and Utilizing Functions in PL/SQL Oracle

This lesson covers the core concepts of creating functions in PL/SQL Oracle. Functions, also known as user-defined functions or stored functions, are a crucial part of the PL/SQL landscape. They are sequences of SQL and PL/SQL statements stored by name in the database's data dictionary, which can be called for reuse. They can have anywhere from zero arguments to dozens, and they return one value of any datatype. Functions can be standalone entities in the data dictionary, or they can be housed within a package along with other procedures and functions. This guide aims to elaborate on how to create these functions, as well as discussing the permissions needed to execute them.

## Creating a Basic Function
<a id="creating-a-basic-function"></a>

Creating a function in SQL Developer involves writing the function in a SQL text file and running it like any other SQL statement. 

For example, the creation of a simple function, `simple_function`, is as follows:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION simple_function RETURN VARCHAR2 IS
BEGIN
  RETURN 'Hello, world!';
END;
```

To test the function, we can execute it using a SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT simple_function FROM dual;
```

However, keep in mind that while a function might compile without any errors, it does not necessarily mean it will run without errors or serve its intended purpose.

## Understanding Function Syntax
<a id="understanding-function-syntax"></a>

Here's a breakdown of the general syntax for creating functions in PL/SQL:

- The first part involves the declaration of the function using `CREATE FUNCTION`, and you can optionally use `OR REPLACE` to indicate that an existing function should be replaced.
- The second part names the function, defines the parameters that the function will accept, and specifies the datatype of the value the function will return.
- The third and often largest part contains the source of the function itself, beginning with the `IS` or `AS` keyword. This includes the declaration of any variables, and the body of the PL/SQL function enclosed between `BEGIN` and `END`.

## Privileges for Creating and Using Functions
<a id="privileges-for-creating-and-using-functions"></a>

Specific privileges are required to create and use functions in Oracle.

To create a function in your own schema, you need the `CREATE PROCEDURE` system privilege. If you need to create or replace functions in another schema, you need the `CREATE ANY PROCEDURE` system privilege.

Executing a function requires the `EXECUTE` object privilege. You can grant this privilege on a function to a specific user, as demonstrated below:

```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON simple_function TO user_OE;
```

This example grants the `EXECUTE` permission on the function `simple_function` to the user `OE`.

## Creating a Function with a Business Rule
<a id="creating-a-function-with-a-business-rule"></a>

Functions can be used to encapsulate complex business rules. Below is an example of a function named `new_salary` that calculates a new salary based on specific business rules. It accepts current salary and department ID as inputs, applies a 20% salary increase to everyone, and further increases the salary by 5% if the department ID is 101.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION new_salary(current_salary IN NUMBER, department_id IN NUMBER)
RETURN NUMBER IS
  working_salary NUMBER;
BEGIN
  working_salary := current_salary * 1.20; -- 20% salary increase for everyone
  IF department_id = 101 THEN -- additional 5% increase for department 101
    working_salary := working_salary * 1.05;
  END IF;
  RETURN working_salary;
END;
```

To verify the logic of your function, you can use a SELECT statement, passing in some sample values:

```sql
SELECT new_salary(5000, 101) FROM dual; -- testing with sample values
```

## Utilizing Functions in SQL Statements
<a id="utilizing-functions-in-sql-statements"></a>

Functions can be invoked as part of SQL statements to streamline data manipulation. The `new_salary` function can be used in an UPDATE statement to update salaries in the employees table:

```sql
UPDATE employees SET salary = new_salary(salary, department_id);
```

In this statement, the salary of each employee is updated according to the rules defined in the `new_salary` function. Note that this operation updates all rows in the `employees` table, as there is no WHERE clause to limit the update to a subset of the rows.

## Conclusion
<a id="conclusion"></a>

Functions in Oracle PL/SQL are instrumental in creating reusable code. To create a function, you'll need the `CREATE PROCEDURE` system privilege. To run someone else's function, the `EXECUTE` object privilege is necessary. A function consists of three main sections: the naming of the function with its parameters and return value type, a declaration section for working variables, and the function body where you can execute your function logic and provide a return at the end. Now you're equipped to start creating your own functions in PL/SQL Oracle.
