# Understanding Built-in PL/SQL Functions and Procedures in Oracle 19c

Oracle's PL/SQL offers the advantages of a modern programming language and integrates seamlessly with the Oracle 19c SQL language. To fully utilize the Oracle's PL/SQL, understanding built-in functions and procedures is essential. These functions and procedures allow you to optimize your database operations and eliminate the need to write your own procedures for common tasks.

## Single Row Functions

Single row functions return a single row or column value for every row of the query. These functions can be used in the select clause, where clause, the start with connect by clause, group by and having clause.

Here's an example of a single row function usage:

```SQL
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department_id 
HAVING MOD(department_id, 9) > 5;
```

In this example, we use the `MOD()` single row numeric function in the `HAVING` clause to filter out department IDs that do not meet the condition.

## Numeric Single Row Functions

These functions are primarily related to mathematical operations, and they return a single numeric value. An important thing to remember is that any numeric function operating on a column or expression that evaluates to `NULL`, returns a `NULL`.

```SQL
SELECT department_id, SQRT(salary) 
FROM employees 
WHERE department_id IS NULL;
```

In this example, we are using the `SQRT()` function on a `NULL` value, which would return `NULL`.

<a name="character-string-single-row-functions"></a>
## Character String Single Row Functions

These functions return character strings. Some are straightforward, while others are more specialized. Here's an example where we use the `SUBSTR()` function to truncate a long string:

```SQL
SELECT SUBSTR(street_address, 1, 20) 
FROM locations;
```

This query truncates the street_address to the first 20 characters.

<a name="date-and-time-single-row-functions"></a>
## Date and Time Single Row Functions

These functions return date, timestamp, or time intervals. They fall into three categories, with one subset storing intervals either in terms of years and months or days and seconds. These are utilized in date arithmetic.

```SQL
SELECT last_name, ADD_MONTHS(hire_date, 100) 
FROM employees 
WHERE last_name = 'Grant';
```

This query shows the future date 100 months after the hire date for employees with the last name 'Grant'.

<a name="conversion-functions"></a>
## Conversion Functions

The conversion functions primarily handle string conversions. They can be categorized into character string related, date-time conversions, and other miscellaneous functions.

```SQL
SELECT TO_CHAR(hire_date, 'DD-MON-YYYY') 
FROM employees;
```

This query converts the `hire_date` from DATE data type to a formatted string.

<a name="general-functions"></a>
## General Functions

General functions include generic comparison operations, large object operations, collection management, XML and JSON manipulations, and low-level encoding and decoding functions. These functions provide a wide range of capabilities for database operations.

<a name="plsql-procedures"></a>
## PL/SQL Procedures

In addition to the built-in functions, there are also PL/SQL procedures. These procedures are typically delivered in a package and you call them from other procedures, as demonstrated below:

```SQL
EXECUTE DBMS_STATS.gather_table_stats(ownname => 'hr', tabname => 'employees');
```

This procedure updates the statistics on the 'employees' table in the 'hr' schema.

<a name="built-in-packages"></a>
## Built-in Packages

Oracle's PL/SQL also includes built-in packages which are useful for DBAs and developers. These packages often return multiple values, which makes them ideal for complex operations.

```SQL
EXECUTE DBMS_SPACE.space_usage('hr', 'employees');
```

This procedure from the DBMS_SPACE package shows how the free space in the 'employees' table is distributed.

Remember, the built-in functions and procedures in Oracle 19c are powerful tools to enhance and simplify your database operations. Explore the [Oracle's official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/) for comprehensive lists and descriptions of all the built-in functions and procedures.
