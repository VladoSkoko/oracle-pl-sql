# Creating and Using Procedures in PL/SQL with Oracle

PL/SQL procedures are an essential part of the Oracle database and play a vital role in modular code development. A stored procedure is a set of PL/SQL statements stored by name in the database's data dictionary, ready to be called whenever needed. Procedures are particularly useful as they can have several arguments and can also be grouped with other procedures and functions into a package for convenient usage. This tutorial will guide you through creating, running, and managing PL/SQL procedures in Oracle.

## Creating Stored Procedures <a name="creating-stored-procedures"></a>

Procedures can be anonymous (not stored permanently in the database) or named (stored in the data dictionary). These can be utilized individually or along with other procedures and functions inside a package. Below is a simple example of a named stored procedure:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE simple_procedure IS
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('This is a simple procedure.');
END;
/
```

This `simple_procedure` doesn't take any parameters, but parameters can be added if needed. Procedures do not return values like functions, but they can modify the parameters passed into them if declared with the `OUT` keyword. This, however, is not common.

## Running Procedures <a name="running-procedures"></a>

Since procedures are not part of SQL, they cannot be called from a `SELECT` statement. Instead, they are usually called from another procedure or from SQL*Plus or SQL Developer using an `EXEC` or `CALL` command.

For example, to execute the above-created `simple_procedure` in SQL*Plus or SQL Developer, you would use:

```sql
EXEC simple_procedure;
```

You can also run a procedure inside an anonymous block. Below is an example of how to run a procedure in this manner:

```sql
BEGIN
    simple_procedure;
END;
/
```

## Procedure Syntax Explained <a name="procedure-syntax-explained"></a>

Creating a procedure has a specific syntax, broken down into several sections.

1. Procedure Declaration: Use the `CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE` command to create a new procedure or replace an existing one. 

2. Parameter Declaration: Name the procedure and declare any parameters it will take. By default, parameters are `IN` parameters, but they can also be declared as `OUT` or `IN OUT`.

3. Procedure Body: Declare any variables that the procedure will use, and then between a `BEGIN` and `END` statement, write the logic of your procedure.

Here is an example that incorporates all these parts:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE display_emp_info (emp_id IN NUMBER, emp_name OUT VARCHAR2) IS
BEGIN
    SELECT ename INTO emp_name FROM emp WHERE empno = emp_id;
END;
/
```

In this example, `emp_id` is an input parameter and `emp_name` is an output parameter.

## Privileges Required for Procedures <a name="privileges-required-for-procedures"></a>

Creating and using stored procedures requires specific privileges. To create a procedure in your schema, you need the `CREATE PROCEDURE` system privilege. If you want to create or replace procedures in another schema, you require the `CREATE ANY PROCEDURE` privilege.

To run procedures, you need the `EXECUTE` object privilege. Below is an example of granting execute privilege:

```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON simple_procedure TO user;
```

Here, the `EXECUTE` privilege on `simple_procedure` is being granted to `user`.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

Oracle PL/SQL procedures are a valuable tool for reusable code. Their ability to take multiple arguments and to be grouped with other procedures and functions into packages offers a modular approach to code development. However, keep in mind the necessary privileges required for creating and running these procedures. Whether you are calling built-in procedures or writing your own, mastering them is essential to work effectively with Oracle databases.
