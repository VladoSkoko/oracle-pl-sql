# Utilizing CONTINUE and EXIT Commands in PL/SQL

PL/SQL, Oracle's procedural extension to SQL, brings forth a wide range of programming constructs that enable control over the flow of execution. Two key constructs are `CONTINUE` and `EXIT`. This lesson is focused on explaining these commands, their applications, and how they influence the operation of loops within PL/SQL. Additionally, alternatives such as `GOTO` and `RETURN` are briefly introduced.

## Understanding Loop Constructs in PL/SQL

PL/SQL supports three types of loops:
1. **Simple loops**: These loops are identified by a starting `LOOP` and an ending `END LOOP`. Exiting these loops requires specific conditions using the `EXIT` statement.
2. **FOR loops**: These loops iterate over a counter until a certain limit is reached.
3. **WHILE loops**: These loops continue running as long as a specified condition holds true.

Here's a brief example of each loop type:

```plsql
-- Simple Loop
DECLARE
   i NUMBER := 1;
BEGIN
   LOOP
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Simple loop count: ' || i);
      i := i + 1;
      IF i > 3 THEN
         EXIT;
      END IF;
   END LOOP;
END;
/

-- FOR Loop
BEGIN
   FOR i IN 1..3 LOOP
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('FOR loop count: ' || i);
   END LOOP;
END;
/

-- WHILE Loop
DECLARE
   i NUMBER := 1;
BEGIN
   WHILE i <= 3 LOOP
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('WHILE loop count: ' || i);
      i := i + 1;
   END LOOP;
END;
/
```

## Working with CONTINUE

The `CONTINUE` statement allows us to skip the current iteration of the loop and start the next one. Here is an example of a `CONTINUE` in a basic loop:

```plsql
DECLARE
   i NUMBER := 1;
BEGIN
   LOOP
      i := i + 1;
      IF MOD(i, 2) = 0 THEN
         CONTINUE;
      END IF;
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Square root of ' || i || ' is ' || SQRT(i));
      IF i >= 9 THEN
         EXIT;
      END IF;
   END LOOP;
END;
/
```

## Understanding EXIT

The `EXIT` statement helps break out of the loop entirely. Here's an example of using `EXIT` in a simple loop:

```plsql
DECLARE
   i NUMBER := 1;
BEGIN
   LOOP
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Square root of ' || i || ' is ' || SQRT(i));
      i := i + 1;
      IF i > 9 THEN
         EXIT;
      END IF;
   END LOOP;
END;
/
```

## Shortcuts: CONTINUE WHEN and EXIT WHEN

PL/SQL allows for simplified constructs `CONTINUE WHEN` and `EXIT WHEN` that perform the same tasks as `CONTINUE` and `EXIT` but in a more concise manner.

```plsql
DECLARE
   i NUMBER := 1;
BEGIN
   LOOP
      i := i + 1;
      CONTINUE WHEN MOD(i, 2) = 0;
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Square root of ' || i || ' is ' || SQRT(i));
      EXIT WHEN i >= 9;
   END LOOP;
END;
/
```

## Alternatives to EXIT: GOTO and RETURN

- `GOTO`: Jumps to a specific point in the code, which could be inside or outside of the loop.
- `RETURN`: Exits the loop as well as the enclosing block in a PL/SQL procedure, returning control to the caller. In the context of a PL/SQL function, `RETURN` also provides the function's return value.
