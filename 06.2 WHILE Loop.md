# Understanding WHILE Loops in PL/SQL with Oracle

This document aims to introduce WHILE loops, a powerful programming construct in Oracle's PL/SQL. WITH loops allow for repeating a block of code and exiting based on a condition evaluated at the start of each loop iteration. We'll explore the structure of a WHILE loop, understand how it works, and illustrate this with code examples. We'll also discuss common scenarios where WHILE loops are most beneficial.

## Basic Structure of WHILE Loops <a name="basic-structure-of-while-loops"></a>

WHILE loops in PL/SQL are defined by a set of statements, starting with the `WHILE` keyword and ending with `END LOOP`. A logical condition is checked at the beginning of each loop iteration. If this condition evaluates to `TRUE`, the loop's code is executed. However, if it evaluates to `FALSE` or `NULL`, the loop is exited.

Here's the syntax of a WHILE loop in PL/SQL:

```plsql
DECLARE
  -- variable declarations here
BEGIN
  WHILE boolean_expression LOOP
    -- statements go here
  END LOOP;
END;
```

In this block, `boolean_expression` is evaluated at the start of each loop iteration. If it is `TRUE`, the statements within the loop are executed. Once it evaluates to `FALSE` or `NULL`, execution continues after the `END LOOP` statement.

## Explaining WHILE Loop Execution <a name="explaining-while-loop-execution"></a>

The operation of a WHILE loop can be simplified into a set of steps:

1. Evaluate the loop condition. If it's `TRUE`, proceed to the next step.
2. Execute the code inside the loop. This code should ideally alter the state of variables such that the condition in step 1 will eventually evaluate to `FALSE` or `NULL`.
3. Return to step 1 and re-evaluate the condition.

This cycle repeats until the condition becomes `FALSE` or `NULL`, at which point execution proceeds after the loop.

## Working with WHILE Loops <a name="working-with-while-loops"></a>

Let's look at an example using WHILE loops. In this anonymous block, we initialize a variable called `loop_count` to 12, and inside the WHILE loop, we check if the square of `loop_count` is less than 300.

```plsql
DECLARE
  loop_count NUMBER := 12;
BEGIN
  WHILE (loop_count*loop_count) < 300 LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Square of ' || loop_count || ' is ' || (loop_count*loop_count));
    loop_count := loop_count + 1;
  END LOOP;
END;
```

In this example, the loop continues until the square of `loop_count` exceeds 300. Each time through the loop, it displays the square of the current `loop_count`, and increments `loop_count`. When `loop_count` reaches 18, the condition evaluates to `FALSE`, and the loop exits.

## Potential Pitfalls with WHILE Loops <a name="potential-pitfalls-with-while-loops"></a>

While using WHILE loops, be careful with the logical condition, as incorrect logic might cause unexpected behaviors:

1. **Loop Never Executed**: If the initial logic is `FALSE`, the loop will never execute.
2. **Infinite Loop**: If the condition is always `TRUE`, it will result in an infinite loop.

For instance, consider the following erroneous examples:

```plsql
-- Loop Never Executed
DECLARE
  loop_count NUMBER := 12;
BEGIN
  WHILE loop_count = loop_count + 1 LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(loop_count);
  END LOOP;
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Outside the loop');
END;
```

In this block, the loop condition is never `TRUE`, and hence, only the statement outside the loop is executed.

```plsql
-- Infinite Loop
DECLARE
  loop_count NUMBER := 12;
BEGIN
  WHILE loop_count > 0 LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(loop_count);
    loop_count := loop_count + 1; -- Wrong logic, this should be decrementing instead
  END LOOP;
END;
```

In this case, the loop condition is always `TRUE`, creating an infinite loop.

## Exiting Loops Using IF Statements <a name="exiting-loops-using-if-statements"></a>

Besides the WHILE condition, we can also use an `IF` statement to break out of a loop based on additional conditions. Consider the following example:

```plsql
DECLARE
  loop_count NUMBER := 12;
BEGIN
  WHILE (loop_count*loop_count) < 300 LOOP
    loop_count := loop_count + 1;
    IF MOD(loop_count, 2) = 0 THEN
      EXIT;
    END IF;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(loop_count);
  END LOOP;
END;
```

In this block, if the incremented value of `loop_count` is an even number, the `EXIT` statement breaks the loop.

## Controlling Nested WHILE Loops Using Labels <a name="controlling-nested-while-loops-using-labels"></a>

For nested WHILE loops, we can use labels to control the execution of our code. When a condition is met in the inner loop, we can exit both the inner and outer loop using the label of the outer loop. Here's an example:

```plsql
DECLARE
  loop_count_outer NUMBER := 1;
  loop_count_inner NUMBER := 1;
  int_sum NUMBER := 0;
BEGIN
  <<outer_loop>>
  WHILE loop_count_outer <= 10 LOOP
    <<inner_loop>>
    WHILE loop_count_inner <= 10 LOOP
      int_sum := int_sum + loop_count_inner;
      IF int_sum > 50 THEN
        EXIT outer_loop; -- Exits the outer loop when int_sum exceeds 50
      END IF;
      loop_count_inner := loop_count_inner + 1;
    END LOOP; -- End of inner loop
    loop_count_outer := loop_count_outer + 1;
  END LOOP; -- End of outer loop
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Sum exceeded 50');
END;
```

In this block, when `int_sum` exceeds 50, it breaks out of both the inner and outer loop, continues execution after both loops, displays a message, and ends execution.

## Working with WHILE Loops and Explicit Cursors <a name="working-with-while-loops-and-explicit-cursors"></a>

In some cases, you may need to use explicit cursors in your WHILE loop. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all rows fetched by the cursor. Here's an example:

```plsql
DECLARE
  CURSOR emp_cur IS SELECT * FROM emps;
  rec_emp emp_cur%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
  OPEN emp_cur;
  FETCH emp_cur INTO rec_emp;
  WHILE emp_cur%NOTFOUND = FALSE LOOP
    -- Perform operation on rec_emp
    FETCH emp_cur INTO rec_emp;
  END LOOP;
  CLOSE emp_cur;
END;
```

In this block, the `emp_cur%NOTFOUND` cursor attribute is checked at the start of each loop iteration. If there are still rows to be fetched (i.e., `emp_cur%NOTFOUND` is `FALSE`), the loop executes.

WHILE loops are a common feature in many procedural programming languages. They offer fine-grained control over the loop's execution, allowing for a high degree of precision. By combining WHILE loops with constructs like `IF` statements and explicit cursors, you can write efficient, flexible code to handle a variety of scenarios in PL/SQL.
