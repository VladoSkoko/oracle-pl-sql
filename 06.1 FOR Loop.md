# Understanding FOR Loops in PL/SQL

FOR loops are a fundamental building block of any procedural language, including Oracle's PL/SQL. By enabling repeated execution of code blocks, they allow efficient operations on data structures such as arrays or row sets. This tutorial will guide you through the functionality of FOR loops in PL/SQL with relevant examples. In this guide, we will discuss the standard FOR loop and the cursor-based FOR loop.

## Standard FOR Loop <a name="standard-for-loop"></a>

A FOR loop in PL/SQL is defined by the keywords `FOR`, `LOOP` and `END LOOP`. The loop will iterate over a sequence of integers in either ascending or descending order.

The syntax for a standard FOR loop is as follows:

```sql
FOR index IN lower_bound..upper_bound LOOP
    -- statements to execute
END LOOP;
```

Where `index` is a local variable that holds the successor values of each iteration. It is important to note that `index` is implicitly declared and always of the integer type.

Here is a simple example that calculates and displays the square roots of the numbers two through five:

```sql
DECLARE
    calc_sqrt NUMBER;
BEGIN
    FOR iterator IN 2..5 LOOP
        calc_sqrt := SQRT(iterator);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The square root of ' || iterator || ' is ' || calc_sqrt);
    END LOOP;
END;
```

In this example, `iterator` is the index variable that goes from `2` to `5`. The FOR loop executes four times, each time calculating and printing the square root of the current value of `iterator`.

## Control Flow in a FOR Loop <a name="control-flow-in-a-for-loop"></a>

There are a variety of ways to control the flow of a FOR loop in PL/SQL:

- **REVERSE**: You can use the `REVERSE` keyword to iterate in reverse order.

```sql
FOR index IN REVERSE lower_bound..upper_bound LOOP
    -- statements to execute
END LOOP;
```

- **CONTINUE**: The `CONTINUE` statement skips the rest of the current loop iteration and continues with the next iteration.

```sql
FOR index IN 1..10 LOOP
    IF index = 5 THEN
        CONTINUE;
    END IF;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(index);
END LOOP;
```

- **EXIT**: The `EXIT` statement exits the loop before it has looped through all its values.

```sql
FOR index IN 1..10 LOOP
    IF index = 5 THEN
        EXIT;
    END IF;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(index);
END LOOP;
```

- **GOTO**: The `GOTO` statement can be used to jump to a label outside of the loop.

```sql
<<outer_block>>
BEGIN
    FOR index IN 1..10 LOOP
        IF index = 5 THEN
            GOTO end_loop;
        END IF;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(index);
    END LOOP;
    <<end_loop>>
    NULL;
END outer_block;
```

- **RETURN**: The `RETURN` statement immediately exits the entire block. If it is a function, you can return a value as with any stored function.

```sql
DECLARE
    calc_sqrt NUMBER;
BEGIN
    FOR iterator IN 2..5 LOOP
        calc_sqrt := SQRT(iterator);
        IF calc_sqrt = 2 THEN
            RETURN;
        END IF;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The square root of ' || iterator || ' is ' || calc_sqrt);
    END LOOP;
END;
```

## Cursor-Based FOR Loop <a name="cursor-based-for-loop"></a>

Cursor-based FOR loops provide a way to iterate over a result set of a query. Instead of iterating through integer values, this type of FOR loop iterates through the results of a query.

```sql
FOR record IN (SELECT * FROM table_name) LOOP
    -- statements to execute
END LOOP;
```

Here is an example where we loop through all rows from an employees table and print the first name of an employee if their last name is "Grant":

```sql
DECLARE
    first_name employees.first_name%TYPE;
BEGIN
    FOR empVal IN (SELECT * FROM employees) LOOP
        IF empVal.last_name = 'Grant' THEN
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(empVal.first_name);
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END;
```

The `empVal` variable is a pointer to each row in the query result. Just as with a regular FOR loop, control statements like `EXIT` and `CONTINUE` can be used within a cursor-based FOR loop.

## Summary <a name="summary"></a>

FOR loops in Oracle PL/SQL are an essential part of the language and offer a powerful way to handle procedural tasks. The standard FOR loop allows for easy iteration over a sequence of integers, while the cursor-based FOR loop facilitates iterating through query result sets. With the various control flow options such as `CONTINUE`, `EXIT`, `GOTO`, and `RETURN`, you have granular control over the execution flow within the loop. Understanding these elements will greatly enhance your PL/SQL programming skills.
